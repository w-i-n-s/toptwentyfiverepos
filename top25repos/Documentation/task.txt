-Create a simple application (Kotlin or Swift depending on the platform) that fetches X topmost contributors (eg 25) for popular GitHub repository (eg ruby or whatever one choses) using GitHub APIs
- Present them in a list sorted by some criteria, eg number of commits
- For each row, show the avatar, user name, number of commits + a button (or anything that acts like a button) which should open a map to show user’s public location if such info is available. For the map, please use any available SDK
– Google Maps or others the candidate most comfortable with
- Implement the tests to the level one thinks is necessary
- Use whatever application architecture you think is suitable. The same goes for the use of 3rd party libraries – use them if you think it makes sense
- Nothing too fancy is expected but the task should demonstrate candidate’s abilities and coding practices to the best - Do NOT spend too much time on the test, let’s limit it to 2 hours maximum. Please provide your thoughts and approaches in case you are out of time.

Actually 2.30 hours is fine
